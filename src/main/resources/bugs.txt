    => DONE // TODO do click/chord when reentering the Cell
TODO show which fields will be chorded before the button(s) are released
TODO import WinMine saves
TODO add achievement description and proper name (toString)
TODO save user configuration (last difficulty, colors active etc.)
TODO gamemode where the user can uprade to a bigger field after win? maybe story progression: easy -> medium -> hard
displayed time lower than win time

In case of doubt, remember that x- and y-chord are inversed on the board.
