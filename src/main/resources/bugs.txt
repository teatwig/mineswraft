Dragging mouse away from a Cell pertains the action (still opening etc.)
    => DONE // TODO do click/chord when reentering the Cell
TODO show which fields will be chorded before the button(s) are released
TODO import WinMine saves
TODO achievements? clear without marking, clear once, clear in time etc. -> replace "click to close" with X -> HBox?
TODO save user configuration (last difficulty, colors active etc.)
TODO gamemode where the user can uprade to a bigger field after win? maybe story progression: easy -> medium -> hard
displayed time lower than win time

In case of doubt, remember that x- and y-chord are inversed on the board.
